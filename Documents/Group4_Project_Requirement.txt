PROJECT REQUIREMENT – GROUP 4
LLM Chatbot Training using Masked Proposal Forms

OBJECTIVE
Design and train an internal LLM-powered chatbot using manually extracted, masked proposal form data. The chatbot must provide accurate, privacy-safe insights strictly based on the supplied dataset and act as the ground-truth intelligence layer for future automation.

SCOPE OF WORK

1. DEFINE CANONICAL DATA SCHEMA
- Identify and finalize all required data fields from masked proposal forms.
- The schema must cover the following major sections:
  - Business / Proposer information (masked)
  - Risk location and premises details
  - Stock, cash, and sum insured values
  - Security setup (CCTV, alarms, safes, strong room, access controls)
  - Transit and guards
  - Claims and insurance history
- Create a data dictionary containing:
  - Field name
  - Field description
  - Data type
  - Allowed values / enums

2. MANUAL DATA EXTRACTION
- Manually extract data from the provided masked proposal forms.
- Ensure:
  - No attempt is made to infer or reconstruct masked/redacted information
  - High accuracy and consistency across records
- Store the extracted data in a structured JSON format.

3. DATA CLEANING AND NORMALIZATION
- Standardize:
  - Date formats
  - Currency values (SGD)
  - Boolean and categorical fields
- Validate numeric ranges and mandatory fields.

4. LLM TRAINING AND CHATBOT SETUP
- Train or configure the LLM using the curated dataset.
- Chatbot responses must:
  - Be strictly limited to available proposal data
  - Avoid assumptions, extrapolation, or hallucinations
- Implement fallback responses for unsupported or unknown queries.

5. VALIDATION AND QUALITY CHECK
- Test the chatbot using sample business queries such as:
  - Proposal summaries
  - Security setup comparisons
  - Risk and coverage insights
- Validate responses for accuracy, consistency, and compliance.

DELIVERABLES
- Final canonical data schema and data dictionary
- Manually curated JSON dataset
- Working internal LLM chatbot
- Sample validated queries and responses

KEY CONSTRAINTS
- Masked data must remain masked at all times.
- Accuracy is prioritized over volume.
- The schema defined by Group 4 will be the reference standard for Group 5 automation.

SUCCESS CRITERIA
- Chatbot responses are accurate and traceable to source data.
- Dataset is clean, structured, and reusable.
- Schema is stable and ready for automated ingestion.
